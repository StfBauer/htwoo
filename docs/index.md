## Why hTWOo

hTWOo is a frontend framework that implements [Microsoft's Fluent Design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/) language with top priority on accessibility, performance and flexibility.

[hTWOo Core](https://lab.n8d.studio/htwoo/htwoo-core/?p=all) implements Microsoft Fluent Design in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only\
[hTWOo React](https://lab.n8d.studio/htwoo/htwoo-react/?path=/story/introduction-getting-started--page) is a React-based component library, that rely solely on the hTWOo-Core implementation.

As additional resource hTWOOo Icons, with it's [icon finder](https://lab.n8d.studio/htwoo/htwoo-core/patterns/design-tokens-icon-overview/design-tokens-icon-overview.rendered.html), provide all Fluent UI Icons as downloadable SVG.

> **Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water.** Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend. - [Bruce Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ))

## Accessibility

Fluent UI Web is only WCAG compliant, hTWOo-Core and hTWOo-React aim to support the full ruleset of [WCAG 2.1-AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance).

I also supports dynamic font scaling which is a requirement for applications like [Microsoft Teams Application](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) a feature that Fluent UI Web cannot offer.

## Why just HTML and CSS

In the end it always comes down to HTML/CSS no matter which framework you use for your development. HTML/CSS documented components serve no other longevity than any other framework. HTML and CSS can also be easily translate, included and embedded in any other development framework.

HTML/CSS UI components can also be easier optimized, refactored or visually enhanced.

## Concepts

hTWOo style guide, documentation and building platform is based on [patternlab.io](https://patternlab.io/). To allow the most flexible implementation of designs and design pattern it follows the [Atomic Design Methodology](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) coined by Brad Frost around 2012 / 2013.

> We're tasked with making interfaces for more users in more contexts using more browsers on more devices with more screen sizes and more capabilities than ever before. That's a daunting task indeed. Thankfully, design systems are here to help. - [Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)
