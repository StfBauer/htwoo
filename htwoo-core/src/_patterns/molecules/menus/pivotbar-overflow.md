title: Pivot Bar with Overflow
---

To make this overflow work. Add the class `.has-overflow` on the pivot container. Also make sure you wrap all buttons in a `.hoo-overflow` container and add an overflow button.

The rest is up to some JavaScript that mange the overflow.

**Accessibility:**
```role="menubar"``` .... gives the user a clear indication on how many buttons are in the current menu
